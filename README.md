# BLP_demand_julia
This is a Julia version implementation of Random Coefficient Logit Demand Estimation (i.e. BLP) in replication of Nevo (2000).
Note that for this version, you need to have pluto and running from there due to the scope of variables issue. 
Latter I would modify it to be able to run from the terminal include method.
